| S.No. | Experiment Name |
| ----- | --------------- |
|1.| [Study of Multiplexer and Demultiplexer.](Experiment1_mux_demux.asm) |
|2.| [Study of Half Adder and Subtractor.](Experiment2_half_adder.asm) |
|3.| [Study of Full Adder and Subtractor.](Experiment3_full_adder.asm) |
|4.| [WAP to add two 8 bit numbers and store the result at memory location 2000.](Experiment4_add_8bit.asm) |
|5.| [WAP to multiply two 8 bit numbers stored at memory location 2000 and 2001 and stores the result at memory location 2000 and 2001.](Experiment5_multiply_8bit.asm) |
|6.| [WAP to add two 16-bit numbers. Store the result at memory address starting from 2000.](Experiment6_add_16bit.asm) |
|7.| [WAP which tests if any bit is '0' in a data byte specified at an address 2000. If it is so, 00 would be stored at address 2001 and if not so then FF should be storedat the same address.](Experiment7_test_zero_bit.asm) |
|8.| [Assume that 3 bytes of data are stored at consecutive memory addresses of the data memory starting at 2000. Write a program which loads register C with (2000), i.e. with data contained at memory address2000, D with (2001), E with (2002) and A with (2001).](Experiment8_load_registers.asm) |
|9.| [Sixteen bytes of data are specified at consecutive data-memory locations starting at 2000. Write a program which increments the value of all sixteen bytes by 01.](Experiment9_increment_16bytes.asm) |
|10.| [WAP to add t 10 bytes stored at memory location starting from 3000. Store the result at memory location 300A.](Experiment10_add_10bytes.asm) |
