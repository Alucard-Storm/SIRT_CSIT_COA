## Computer Org.& Architecture (List of Practicals)

1. Study of Multiplexer and Demultiplexer
2. Study of Half Adder and Subtractor
3. Study of Full Adder and Subtractor
4. WAP to add two 8 bit numbers and store the result at memory location 2000
5. WAP to multiply two 8 bit numbers stored at memory location 2000 and 2001 and stores the result at memory location 2000 and 2001.
6. WAP to add two 16-bit numbers. Store the result at memory address starting from 2000.
7. WAP which tests if any bit is '0' in a data byte specified at an address 2000. If it is so, 00 would be stored at address 2001 and if not so then FF should be storedat the same address.
8. Assume that 3 bytes of data are stored at consecutive memory addresses of the data memory starting at 2000. Write a program which loads register C with (2000), i.e. with data contained at memory address2000, D with (2001), E with (2002) and A with (2001).
9. Sixteen bytes of data are specified at consecutive data-memory locations starting at 2000. Write a program which increments the value of all sixteen bytes by 01.
10. WAP to add t 10 bytes stored at memory location starting from 3000. Store the result at memory location 300A
